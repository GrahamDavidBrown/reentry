# reEntry
(Original working title: Second Chances)

Final Project at The Iron Yard - May 2017 - by Graham Brown, Luis Garcia, Vallyre Hyers, Dana Walker

Our team’s app, ReEntry, connects the formerly incarcerated with those willing to hire them.  Built using a React front-end that interfaces with our Python and Django-based RESTful API on the back-end, ReEntry is designed to have a simple user interface to enable individuals who may be lacking digital literacy to showcase the skills they do have, and contact potential employers whose positions they were matched to based on those skills.  Our goal is to reduce this country’s nearly eighty percent five-year recidivism rate by helping those who have already paid their debt to society to find the jobs and resources they need for achieving sustainable self-sufficiency.

Front-end deployed on Heroku free server:
